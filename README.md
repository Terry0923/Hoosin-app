# Hoosin-app

This is the HoosIn application

HoosIn is a skill matching platform that allows UVA students to find other peers with similar interests, or seek out mentors for new pursuits. Students can update their profile with academic information, join skill groups based on their expertise, and browse other students and skill groups.

## Installation

Hoosin is a standalone web application, but to develop locally, check requirements.txt. It specifies what installations are needed.

Upon login, you'll initially be redirected to the dashboard, which displays the courses, skill groups and students that you follow.

To go back to dashboard at any point, click the Hoosin Logo on the top left of the navigation bar.

Click "Students", "Courses", or "Skill Groups" to find students you may know, courses you are enrolled in or interested about, and skill groups that you want to pursue or are already a member of.
While courses have been imported from Lous List and are only accessible to admins, students may create a skill group to find like-minded peers.

Click "Search" to search for existing students, courses, or skill groups.

Click "Profile" to update your own profile information. Here, you can write a short bio, specifically set your status to indicate to others that you'd like to study together,
and also add information like year and major to make it easier for other users to connect with you. 

Click "Students", go to the students that you are interested in following, click "Follow". You may view your friends under "Your Friends" on dashboard. You can unfollow them by clicking "Unfollow". 
While most students' usernames are their computing IDs by default, you can also click on specific profile
to learn more about a given user and reach out via email.

Click "Courses", go to the courses that you are interested in, click "Add course". You may view your courses under "Your Courses" on dashboard. You can remove courses by clicking "Remove Course".

Click "Skill Groups", You may add a skill group by clicking "Add a Skill Group". Go to those groups you are interested in joining and click "Join Group". 
You may view members in the skill group under "Members," if you'd like to reach out to them individually, and access their profiles from this page.

Within the skill group page, Click "Add a post" to add to the group's feed. You have the option to add posts (either events, announcements, or miscellaneous postings) only if you are a member of the group. 
You may like the post if it is an announcement, or choose to attend if it is an event. Click a event or announcement that you are interested in. You may add a comment by clicking "Add a Comment". 

To view users who have liked an announcement, or indicated they are attending an event, hover over "attending" or "liked by". You may view their profile information by clicking their names. 

You may view your skill groups under "Your Skill Groups" on dashboard.
